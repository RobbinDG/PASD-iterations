\textsl{Main Success Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The user starts the `file search request' transaction with the system, having all parameters of the user to be added ready.
	\item The system returns a list of all ``Regular Customers'' that have paid the search system registration fee and a list of ``Item Catalogues'' to the user.
	\item The user chooses the customer from the first list and a item catalogue (if so desired; may be ignored) and presents the selections to the system, along with a maximum price the customer is willing to pay.
	\item The system creates the search request with the item catalogue, the maximum price and the customer interested and adds it to the search system's list. The system also generates a Search ID for the request for reference.
	\item The system informs the customer via email that the request has been made.
	\item The system returns to the user with a confirmation message containing the Search ID, or a failure.
\end{enumerate}
\textsl{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item If the yearly fee has not been paid, the system will return a failure and ends the transaction.
	\item When a failure is returned, the system state remains unchanged; no search request or other parameters was added.
	\item When not all required parameters were provided, the system will first ask the user to provide it until all parameters is provided.
\end{itemize}
