	Dear John,\\

I noticed you forgot to inform us about the frequency of occurrence of the search request. It is vital for the development stage for us to know how often per month a search request is filed (on average).

Regards,\\
Your trusty development team (group 9)\\

Dear people from group 9,\\

The frequency of Search request varies a lot. Sometimes we have 3 on one day, sometimes only one in a whole week. On average, I would say we have approx 12 per month.

Dear John,\\

Quick question, how ofter (per month) do you expect to have customers sign up for the "regular customer" plan?\\

Dear people from team 9.\\

W.r.t. your question: since we introduced the possibility of becoming a regular customer, a lot of people used this option (the first month in 2010 we had 350 registrations). At the moment, I guess approx between 5  and 10 persons per month register to be a regular customer. There is always a peak directly after an auction since relatively a lot of the persons visiting such an auction for the first time, will also be a regular customer (although I guess approx half of them do not fill in the form the next year to continue being a regular costumer).
