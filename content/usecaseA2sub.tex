	so their credentials are available.\end{tabular}\\
\textbf{Postconditions}:&\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l}
	The buyer is registered as having paid the fee.\end{tabular}\\
\textbf{Special requirements}:&\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l}-\end{tabular}\\
\textbf{Frequency of occurence}:& \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l}As often as a search request is being made (or fewer if a customer\\requests more than one item). So, 10 to 12 timer per month.\end{tabular}

\textsl{Main Success Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The user starts the `pay search system fee' transaction with the system.
	\item The system returns a list of all registered ``regular customers'' to the user, also displaying the time their current registration (if there is one) is still valid.
	\item The user chooses the correct buyer from the list.
	\item The system marks the buyer as ``having paid the fee'', and sets the time their registration remains to 1 year.
	\item The system returns to the user with a Success message.
\end{enumerate}
\textsl{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item The buyer that wants to pay the fee, might not have been registered. In this case user can manually abort the registration.
\end{itemize}
