The AuctionHouse\textsuperscript{TM} administration system supports a range of requests from different users. The report describes how these requests are processed and how the system will change on multiple different levels of understanding. Much of it is ready for the implementation stage, and we expect this to happen in the near future. The future might bring additions to the system, as John, our client, requests them. The system in its current state is ready for such additions and processing these should not prove difficult.\\
To briefly summarize, John requested a system that would manage administration of his auction house company. Initially, this mean keeping track of the items for sale for potential lookup by viewers and other parties such as the police. Quickly after, we received another request that capitalized more on the digital nature of the new system-to-be. John wanted to bright a search requests system to life which allowed customers to order John to look for a certain product. Later, John requested to have all transactions and system changes be logged and administrated, again because of the digital nature of the system.\\
John proved to be an eager client and regularly updates his set of requests (which is a good thing). We look forward to a response of our client, and after sending it to the implementation stage.
