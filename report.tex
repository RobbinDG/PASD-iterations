General Impression: 8

TODOs
All:
 - Think about how the printouts can be digitalized without having e.g. the police access the system.
 - Name design considerations for the DM
 - Update user wishes, stories and the like to fit the new requirements
 - Power tree and Domain Model need updating according to the new requirements
 - In the class diagram, make sure all visibility is logical (currently, everything is public, marked with +.) See slides for definitions of +, -, #, ~ etc...
 - Add an auction object to DM

Robbin:
 x Update SSD
 x One UC should specify one session. YOu might add more than 1 item per session
 x Check reply from customer
 x A2 Special Overflows.
 - makes sense of class diagram
 - do white box for B1

Oli:
 - Update SSD
 x Specify in UC title what you are updating
 x One UC should specify one session. YOu might update more than 1 item per session
 x Stakeholders and interests box overflows on the left. Use \makecell[l]{text1//text2} for multiline text in tabular
 x ``Frequency of occurence: Frequent'' <-- seriously?!
 x Specify what transaction you are starting and with what parameters
 x ``information'' is ambiguous and non-specific. Use parameters instead.
 x Updated bb-SD B1
 - Usecase B2
 - bb-SD B2
 - gb and wb for C1
 - gb and wb for A2
 - there are 2 itemIDs in your blackbox. are they the same? are they different? maybe explain?
  
Nicu:
 - Update SSD
 - Specify in UC title what you are deleting
 - One UC should specify one session. YOu might delete more than 1 item per session
 - Honestly, just check the pictures. There's so many comments and remarks.
 - For SSD, instead of e.g. ``answered yes'', you could do b = answerPrompt(), and have the condition be ``b is true''
 - Defined what ``selected for deletion'' is.
 - finish your use case 2 - yur fren, Robbinho

\underline{\textbf{Notice:}} Student B (Oliver) did not manage to finish his grey and white box sequence diagrams in time. Therefore, the document is incomplete. We kindly ask the grader to take this into consideration when grading, and that student A and C (Robbin and Nicu) will not have points deducted, since all their work and effort is in the document. Thanks.

\textbf{Minor clarification}: This white box sequence diagram contains only the Interface-Kernel associations that do not represent Kernel "procedures" (that is, methods that do not return anything to the interface). We justify this with the fact that these methods are represented on the Kernel level by simple atomic instructions (remove an element from the list), and are dependent on the same data as other atomic instructions, the separation of which results in overly complex and unclear design. Although this may deviate from some of the standards, we opted for it since, in our opinion, it allows us to preserve both the initially planned functionality, and the simplicity and clarity of a good design.

The class diagram is a relational diagram between concepts that is closer to the implementation that the Domain Model. It tries to sketch a rough estemate about how the implementation could be realised. It has a great resemblance to object oriented programming since every class can be directly copied into code as a prototype for a future implementation.\\
The functions are derived from the white box sequence diagrams.\\
This class diagram is heavily based on relations, especially inheritance. Since our power tree is in essence an abstract simplified form of the class diagram. The primary goal is to have the user be the direct request parser for the interface. This ensures that any change in the kernel does not result in having to change the interface.\\
When the user authenticates itself, it is either staff or a member which we define as a (subclass of) Role, and attains the functions coming with that user class. This hides other functions that the user is not permitted to use, limiting the power to change the system to a minimum set of functions. As long as the user is permitted, it has access to 4 managers that are collections of (indirectly) all other classes.\\
All attributes are encapsulated. This is done by limiting the visibility to other classes. Functions are the only way to modify an instance of a class, and as we established, the functions available is limited to the role of the user.\\

Below is a set of support classes that are used to define groups of parameters. However, these are added just to simplify the function arguments and do not add any value.

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item \label{conv1}\textsl{Us:}\\
	Dear John,\\

I noticed you forgot to inform us about the frequency of occurrence of the search request. It is vital for the development stage for us to know how often per month a search request is filed (on average).

Regards,\\
Your trusty development team (group 9)\\

\textsl{John:}\\
Dear people from group 9,\\

The frequency of Search request varies a lot. Sometimes we have 3 on one day, sometimes only one in a whole week. On average, I would say we have approx 12 per month.
