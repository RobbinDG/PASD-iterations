\section*{Introduction}
An auctioning company called ``The AuctionHouse\textsuperscript{TM}'' auctions provided goods to buyers. Currently, they auction and display the goods in a warehouse just outside of city limits. Owner John wants to automate the administration of auctions and other activities using an IT solution.

\section*{Expectations Summary and Conclusion}
John wants the sellers to be able to register their goods in the to-develop-system. These goods then need to be assessed and possibly removed if they lack the requirements. A couple of days before an auction, potential buyers must be able to view the goods. The goods are then auctioned at location (so not through the system).\\
Currently, regular customers get mail informing them of the goods on sale, rather than having to go and see the availlable goods in person.\\
Payments are done through cash or card, and not through credit cards. Bigger customers get offered a special billing procedure.
The police is handed a list of goods on auctions, so they can identify any stolen goods.
Once the system is completed, a system administrator should make sure every person has the right permissions for the system, and verify that it is operating properly.
