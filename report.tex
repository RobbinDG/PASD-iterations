Grades from previous iterations:
Iteration 1:
UC1 (A1): 6
UC2 (B1): 6
UC3 (C1): 5
DM: 7
Rest: 9

Iteration 2:
DM: 6 <- what went wrong here
CD: 5
UC4/A2: 5
UC5/B2: 6
UC6/C2: 7
SD1/A1: 7 (by Nicu)
SD2/B1: 9 (by Robbin) <- see what was so good about this one and replicate
SD3/C1: 7 (by Nicu)
SD4/A2: 0 (thanks oli)
SD5/B2: 0 (thanks oli)
SD6/C2: 5 (by Robbin)
General Impression: 8

TODOs
All:
 - Name design considerations for the DM
 - Update user wishes, stories and the like to fit the new requirements
 - Power tree and Domain Model need updating according to the new requirements
 - In the class diagram, make sure all visibility is logical (currently, everything is public, marked with +.) See slides for definitions of +, -, #, ~ etc...
 - Add an auction object to DM
 - Consider adding the following classes to the class diagram: 
 	Regular customer, mailing list (physical address), emailing list (digital address), Item categories, ?notification/email?, 

Robbin:
  
Nicu:
 - Update SSD
 - Specify in UC title what you are deleting
 - One UC should specify one session. YOu might delete more than 1 item per session
 - Honestly, just check the pictures. There's so many comments and remarks.
 - For SSD, instead of e.g. ``answered yes'', you could do b = answerPrompt(), and have the condition be ``b is true''
 - Defined what ``selected for deletion'' is.
 - finish your use case 2 - yur fren, Robbinho

\underline{\textbf{Notice:}} Student B (Oliver) did not manage to finish his grey and white box sequence diagrams in time. Therefore, the document is incomplete. We kindly ask the grader to take this into consideration when grading, and that student A and C (Robbin and Nicu) will not have points deducted, since all their work and effort is in the document. Thanks.

\textbf{Minor clarification}: This white box sequence diagram contains only the Interface-Kernel associations that do not represent Kernel "procedures" (that is, methods that do not return anything to the interface). We justify this with the fact that these methods are represented on the Kernel level by simple atomic instructions (remove an element from the list), and are dependent on the same data as other atomic instructions, the separation of which results in overly complex and unclear design. Although this may deviate from some of the standards, we opted for it since, in our opinion, it allows us to preserve both the initially planned functionality, and the simplicity and clarity of a good design.
